## User Customized Rules for Soda Theme

Made for Sublime Text 3.

Added icons from FileIcons by braver.  
Larger fonts for tabs, side bar, command palette, quick panels.  
Removed font shadows from tabs, sidebar and statusbar for light theme.  
Added setting to hide the scroll buttons on tab bar.  
Added setting to make auto-complete popups and all scroll bars blend in with color schemes. They will look similar to the Default theme.  

Added settings (use in Sublime preferences):

 - soda_blend_auto_complete - set to `true` for autocomplete popup similar to default theme
 - soda_blend_auto_complete_row - set to `true` for a selection row with variable tint instead of a blue/dark texture
 - soda_blend_scrollbar - set to `true` for scrollbars similar to default theme
 - soda_blend_sidebar_row - set to `true` for a sidebar selected row with tint instead of blue/gray texture
 - soda_show_tabbar_scroll_buttons - set to `true` to show the previous/next arrow buttons on the tab bar
